# My Movie Application

Simple application IÂ´ve been working on, to learn how to use an API, so I chose The Movie DB API (https://developers.themoviedb.org)

## Notes

- IMPORTANT: you must create a apikey.txt file (root) and put your API key in it. More information on how to get your API Key you can find [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api).
- Using VSCode as my IDE
- Using just vanilla JS, CSS and HTML
- Just needed the movie genres code and found it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/radarr/comments/70egj8/tmdb_genre_id_values/).
